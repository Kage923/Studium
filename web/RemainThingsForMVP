1) Auth & user identity (email/password only)
Set up Firebase project (Auth + Firestore or RTDB).
Add Firebase config to the web app using .env and a firebaseClient.ts.
Create auth UI: sign up, sign in, sign out (modal or auth page).
Wrap app in AuthProvider and make Tutor/Plan/Flashcards/Profile read the current user.
Guard data so only logged‑in users can see/manipulate their own stuff.
2) Data models & persistence
Define schemas (even if informal) for:
Users, tutor sessions, messages.
Daily plans/tasks.
Decks/flashcards, quizzes.
Wire Plan tab to Firestore: CRUD for today’s plan & tasks.
Wire Flashcards tab to Firestore: CRUD for decks and cards.
Persist chat sessions/messages for Tutor instead of keeping them only in React state.
3) AI integration (Theodore + generation)
Choose AI provider (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini) and add server‑side client (Node/Cloud Function/etc.).
Design prompts for Theodore that enforce your tone: supportive, clear, slightly formal, no slang/shaming.
Create Tutor API endpoint (/api/tutor/message) that:
Takes user message + context.
Calls LLM.
Returns Theodore’s reply and stores it.
Replace dummy tutor reply in the frontend with the real API call.
Create Plan generation endpoint (/api/plan/generateToday):
Uses stored goals/deadlines + past behavior.
Returns a task list.
Create Flashcard/quiz generation endpoint (/api/flashcards/generateFromNotes):
Takes pasted notes.
Returns structured cards (and optionally quiz questions).
Hook Plan tab “Generate today’s plan” to that endpoint.
Hook Flashcards “Create from notes” to that endpoint.
4) Quick quizzes & exam‑style practice
Extend Flashcards model to include quizzes or link quizzes to decks.
Add Quiz UI (could be a sub‑view of Flashcards):
Question, answer input/options, feedback, next/previous, final summary.
Generate questions (using existing cards or AI endpoint) and store quiz attempts per user.
Summaries in Profile: show basic quiz stats (attempts, accuracy).
5) Onboarding & goals
Add simple onboarding flow on first login:
Main subject/goal.
Key exam or deadline dates.
Store onboarding data with the user profile in Firestore.
Feed that data into AI prompts for Tutor and Plan generation.
6) Brand & UX polish for MVP
Load Montserrat / Inter / Nunito properly (e.g., Google Fonts, @font-face).
Extract inline styles into CSS classes to keep JSX clean and make future theme tweaks easy.
Mobile responsiveness pass (especially for chat, plan list, flashcards layout).
Add a minimal landing/welcome state for new users explaining Theodore + main tabs.
7) Deployment & ops
Set up build & deploy pipeline:
Frontend to Vercel/Netlify.
Backend to Vercel functions / Firebase Functions / Render, etc.
Configure production env vars (Firebase keys, AI keys).
Add minimal error handling & logging on the backend for failed LLM/Firebase calls.
